1. clone the repository and open it in an eclipse or an intellij evnironment
2.  now create a new database connection in mysql workbench, the connection name should be root and the password should be chiruhas2000, if you wish to change the credentials you are welcome to do so but, update them in code too.
3.  now inside the database connection create a new database with name "inventory", once it is done run the script inside the file "inventory.sql", this will create all the required tables and insert dummy data.
